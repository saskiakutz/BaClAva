# Bayesian_analysis_GUI
GUIs for the bayesian analysis code

## Simulation GUI
This GUI helps the user with the setup of the simulation.

- the user needs to specify various parameters, which all have default values.
    - number of clusters
    - number of molecules per cluster
    - model (so far there is only a Gaussian model)
    - standard deviation for the Gaussian model
    - background relative to the clustered data
    - size of the region of interest (ROI) in [nm, nm]
    - storage directory/folder
    
- so far no backend support
