# Project name: Bayesian software
# Description:
Bayesian software is a software tool for clustering data from single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) with a 
Bayesian model. This tool offers the option to simulate SMLM-like localisations, do the clustering of the localisation
with a Bayesian model, and postprocess single as well as multiple experiments. Hence, the user will get non-user-biased
clustering results in a reasonable amount of time.

## Simulation tool:
With this simulation tool, the user can simulate simple Gaussian-like clusters. Upon starting the simulation tool, the
user can adjust various parameters for the simulations themselves, the number of simulations and the storage directory.
The user can only start the simulation process after choosing a proper directory.
